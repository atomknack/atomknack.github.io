<h1>Pavel Ivanov - was known as atomknack</h1>
<p>If somebody relied on my software - currently I cannot do anything</p>
<p>My relatives sending me to mental institution</p>
<p>If I ever recover, I try to find ways to make it better</p>
<p>Currently - I am a mess, mad, inefficient and broken mess</p>
<p>Even if all my computer world stop and just freeze, it still better than alternatives</p>
<p>I can't do anything, so now it would be people around who still like me for what I in real life 
making desicions for me, somehow there are still such people</p>
